Inducítrica is a leader in lemon production, with over 30 years of experience and strategically located fields in the south of Tucumán, one of the best regions for citrus cultivation. We specialize in the commercialization of lemon-derived products, such as concentrated juice, essential oil, and dehydrated peel, in both conventional and organic versions, ensuring total traceability and absolute process control, thanks to our own fruit.

Committed to sustainability, we conduct life cycle assessments (LCA-ISO 14040/44) and diversify our agricultural activities, including sugarcane, soybeans, grains, blueberries, oranges, and avocados.

With strong growth projections, Inducítrica has become Argentina's leading fruit exporter, with expansion plans to reach 70,000 tons in the next 5 to 10 years.
