  title: "Company projections for 2031"
  description: Considering these projections and the group's growth, there is a need to establish a factory to industrialize its own lemons. Today, the group has 35,000 tons of its own fruit, and production projections will exceed 60,000 tons in the next five years. This leads to the need to initiate discussions aimed at securing a commercialization and supply contract with Coca-Cola Company.
